mlflow_1st_exp_SupervisedL_RandomForestClassifier

✅ Learning type: Supervised Learning (Classification)
✅ Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier
✅ Hyperparameters being tuned:
n_estimators → Number of trees
max_depth → Depth of each tree

✅ Goal:
Train multiple models with different settings
Compare accuracy in MLflow
Choose the best-performing model




Classification Examples (Predict a Category)
    Email → Spam or Not Spam
    Customer → Will buy or not buy
    Image → Cat, Dog, or Bird
    Flower → Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
    Disease → Positive or Negative
    👉 Output is a label / class


Regression Examples (Predict a Number)
    House price → ₹45,00,000
    Temperature tomorrow → 32.5°C
    Sales next month → 1200 units
    Salary prediction → ₹8.5 LPA
    Stock price → ₹1,234.50
    👉 Output is a continuous number


Classification Algorithms:
  Logistic Regression
  RandomForestClassifier
  KNN Classifier
  SVM (Classifier)
  XGBoost Classifier
  Neural Networks (for classification)

Regression Algorithms:
  Linear Regression
  RandomForestRegressor
  XGBoost Regressor
  Ridge / Lasso
  SVR (Support Vector Regressor)
  Neural Networks (for regression)

Use classification when you want to predict a category, and use regression when you want to predict a number.
